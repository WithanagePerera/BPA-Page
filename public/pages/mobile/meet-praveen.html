                    <ul><li><p><b>What experiences have you had in Business Professionals of America to prepare you for state office?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>I’ve been a team leader for 3 years now and with it I’ve gained a lot of experience as a leader. Being a leader in BPA has allowed me to develop strong organization and management skills, which in my experience have been critical to effective leadership.</p>
                </div>

                <div class = 'question' id = 'Q2'>
                    <ul><li><p><b>What experiences have you had outside of BPA to prepare you for state office?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>I’m part of several organizations involved in making something or providing some service. During those times, I’m not a team leader, rather a follower. Those experiences have given me perspective on what separates a leader from their followers, the qualities people seek in them, and how to work collaboratively.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class = 'question' id = 'Q3'>
                    <ul><li><p><b>What makes you a leader?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>From my experiences, I’ve learned how to follow and lead. It comes down to being able to see the bigger picture and visualizing how to get there. For me, I can picture what needs to be accomplished and how to collaborate using my teammates’ strengths to tackle the problem.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class = 'question' id = 'Q4'>
                    <ul><li><p><b>Can you commit time to being a state officer?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>Of course! I’m passionate about BPA. If it means having the opportunity to make positive change for future delegates and better this organization, then the time I invest is well worth it. It’s my promise to persevere for others because that’s what leaders do.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class = 'question' id = 'Q5'>
                    <ul><li><p><b>What changes and enhancements will you make as a state officer?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>I want to pursue experiences and opportunities that allow our delegates to work with professionals and businesses and to confidently say they are business professionals. I also want to provide equal opportunities and experiences to chapters across the state through collaboration and targeting constraints with costs, information, and communication.</p>
                </div>

                <div class = 'question' id = 'Q6'>
                    <ul><li><p><b> What do you think your biggest challenge as state officer will be?</b></p></li></ul>
                    <p>I think my biggest challenge would be working with individuals located all across the state on the officer team. With differing schedules and availabilities, it may be a challenge to collaborate and find time to meet, but I’m confident that our shared interests will allow us to overcome this.</p>
